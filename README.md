# Tater Tube

Tater Tube is a free, open-source, retro VCR-style media frontend for Linux
x86_64. This repository is the desktop edition being prepared for release on
Steam. It keeps the Tater Tube, PC Link, Game Center, and RetroNAS features
while replacing Raspberry Pi appliance controls with desktop-safe behavior.

The original ready-to-flash Raspberry Pi edition remains available in the
[Tater Tube Pi repository](https://github.com/TaterTotterson/Tater-Tube).
The two repositories are independent, so Steam-specific packaging work does
not replace or overwrite the Pi project.

See [Steam build and packaging](docs/STEAM.md) and the
[release-readiness checklist](docs/STEAM-RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md). Draft text for
the Steam partner page is in [docs/STEAM-STORE-COPY.md](docs/STEAM-STORE-COPY.md).

## Modules

### The Tube

The Tube connects Tater Tube to [Tater Tube Server](https://github.com/TaterTotterson/tater-tube-server). This is the server-backed module for Newznab streaming, local server libraries, server-side transcoding, and custom Local TV Mode channels.

- Pair with a short PIN from the Tater Tube Server web UI
- Browse Stream and Local sections separately
- Stream includes Newznab movie, TV, music, search, and trending views
- Local includes movie, TV, and folder libraries configured on the server
- Local TV Mode supports custom channels, automatic channels, commercials, and live timeline channel switching
- Player-side quality options can request Auto, CRT 480p, HDMI 1080p, or HDMI 4K transcoding
- Server keeps Newznab credentials, local media paths, hardware transcoding settings, and library scanning off the Pi

Run Tater Tube Server on a NAS, desktop, or home server, usually through Docker. Map `/config` for server settings, map any local media folders you want to expose, and pass hardware devices such as `/dev/dri` when using hardware transcoding. Full server setup lives in the [server repo](https://github.com/TaterTotterson/tater-tube-server).

### Video on Demand

- Emby, Jellyfin, and Plex library browsing
- Plex PIN sign in through `https://plex.tv/link`
- Movies, TV, Other Videos, resume playback, autoplay next episode, audio tracks, and subtitles
- TV Mode creates movie, TV, genre, cartoon, classic, and decade-style channels when metadata is available
- Custom TV Mode channels can be created in Web Setup from selected movies and series
- Local commercial categories can be used between videos and as optional mid-roll breaks

### Tape Deck

- Streams music from Emby/Jellyfin, Plex, or Tater Tube Server
- Shows each album as a tape
- Cassette-style playback screen with audio-reactive VU bars
- Next track uses a short tape-style fast-forward effect

### Over The Air

- Direct HDHomeRun playback
- No guide required
- Opens like an old TV tuner
- Up/down changes channels during playback

### Public Access

- Plays saved YouTube playlists through mpv and yt-dlp
- Accepts a full playlist URL or just the playlist code
- Supports multiple playlists, playlist refresh, autoplay next, and shuffle
- TV Mode turns playlists into shuffled channels with optional local commercials

### Game Center

- Browses RetroNAS/MiSTer-style ROM folders
- Launches directly into RetroArch
- Supports common Pi-friendly systems up through PlayStation when matching cores are available
- Uses one global RetroPad controller map across cores

### PC Link

- Pairs with Sunshine hosts through Moonlight
- Lists and launches Sunshine apps
- Includes CRT, HD, 1440p, and 4K stream presets
- Controller streaming depends on host-side virtual gamepad support

### Local Files

- Browses folders on the Pi
- Plays common video formats
- Supports `m3u` and `m3u8` playlists
- Loop and shuffle options

## Web Setup

Steam builds keep the setup service disabled by default. To opt in, launch
Tater Tube with `MP240_API_ENABLED=1`, then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:24024/setup
```

The Raspberry Pi edition enables Web Setup on the local network and uses:

```text
http://tatertube.local:24024/setup
```

Use Web Setup for module logins, API keys, HDHomeRun setup, Tater Tube Server pairing, RetroNAS paths, Sunshine pairing, Bluetooth/gamepad settings, local commercial uploads, and custom TV Mode channels.

Commercials are local files uploaded into categories. Video on Demand, Public Access TV Mode, and The Tube Local TV Mode can all use the selected commercial categories without relying on YouTube playlists.

If `MP240_API_TOKEN` is set, Web Setup and API calls require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-240MP-Token: <token>`.

## Local API

Tater Tube includes a small HTTP API for companion apps and voice-assistant
bridges. Steam builds disable it by default and bind it to localhost when
enabled. The Pi edition runs it on port `24024` on the local network.

```bash
curl http://tatertube.local:24024/api/v1/status
```

Useful endpoints:

```text
GET  /api/v1/status
POST /api/v1/player/play-pause
POST /api/v1/player/pause
POST /api/v1/player/resume
POST /api/v1/player/stop
POST /api/v1/player/seek          {"position_ms": 60000} or {"offset_ms": 30000}
POST /api/v1/player/skip-forward  {"offset_ms": 30000}
POST /api/v1/player/skip-back     {"offset_ms": -10000}
POST /api/v1/player/volume-up
POST /api/v1/player/volume-down
POST /api/v1/player/mute
POST /api/v1/player/key           {"key": "LEFT", "repeat": 1}
POST /api/v1/library/search       {"query": "batman", "types": ["movie", "show", "game"], "limit": 10}
POST /api/v1/library/launch       {"id": "vod:movie:ITEM_ID"}
```

Search results return launch IDs such as `vod:movie:...`, `vod:show:...`, and `game:nes:...`.

## Install

The public Steam build is still in pre-release testing. Linux developers can
fetch the checksum-pinned runtimes and create the same staged depot through
Valve's Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 SDK:

```bash
./scripts/fetch-steam-runtime-bundle.sh out/steam-runtime
./scripts/build-steam-sniper.sh
```

The depot is written to `out/steam/depot`. See [docs/STEAM.md](docs/STEAM.md)
for runtime bundles, validation, and Steamworks manifests.

For Raspberry Pi images, installation, GPIO/Argon support, and appliance
updates, use the
[Tater Tube Pi repository](https://github.com/TaterTotterson/Tater-Tube).

## Credits

Tater Tube started as a fork of [anthonycaccese/240-MP](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-MP). This desktop edition focuses on The Tube, Emby/Jellyfin and Plex playback, HDHomeRun OTA, Public Access playlists, Tape Deck, RetroNAS games, and PC Link. Raspberry Pi appliance and Argon hardware support remain in the separate Pi repository.
