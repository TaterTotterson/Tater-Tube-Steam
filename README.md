# 240-MP

240-MP is a retro VCR-style media frontend for Raspberry Pi, preferably hooked up to a CRT TV over composite video.

Playback experiences are handled via modules so new integrations can be added without reshaping the shell. This fork includes Local Files, Video on Demand for local Emby/Jellyfin servers, and Ambient Mode for looping video/audio ambience.

It launches [mpv](https://mpv.io/) as the playback engine. The ready-to-flash image and Raspberry Pi installer install the required runtime dependencies for you.

## Install 
- [Ready-to-flash Raspberry Pi image](INSTALL.md#option-1-build-a-ready-to-flash-appliance-image)
- [On a Raspberry Pi](INSTALL.md#on-a-raspberry-pi)
- [Build from source / local macOS testing](BUILDING.md)

## Hardware Testing
- Primary target: Raspberry Pi 4 with composite output to a CRT
- Also expected to work on Raspberry Pi OS Lite arm64 over HDMI
- Raspberry Pi 3/3B+ can work with lower playback headroom; see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#video-decode-tuning-mpv_video_args)
- Raspberry Pi 5 is best treated as HDMI-first unless your composite hardware path is known-good

## FAQs

- Why didn't you use Kodi/LibreELEC/OSMC?
    - I've used all of those distros and they are all excellent but I also like making things and wanted something simpler without as many options.  Something that felt like a VCR from my youth.
- Should I use 240-MP instead of Kodi/LibreELEC/OSMC?
    - No.
    - All of those distros are amazing, feature rich, work across a ton of devices and have awesome supportive teams behind them.
    - I on the other hand am just one person making nostalgic things for my own niche use cases.  If those use cases match with what you're looking for, then 240-MP is a bunch of fun and I'd be happy for you to try it.  Otherwise, the well known distros are spectacular and you should likely open those doors instead.
- Will this work on other Raspberry Pi models? (like the 5, 2 zero, etc...)
    - Sorry, I can't say for sure as I've only tested on the 4b, 3b+ and 3b and don't have plans to test on other devices at this time.
- Where does the name "240-MP" come from?
    - 240 has a double meaning referring to the longest [VHS tape length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS#Tape_lengths) and my primary display target for it of [CRT TVs](https://consolemods.org/wiki/CRT:What_is_240p%3F).
    - MP also has a double meaning of "Media Player" and a play on the "SP/LP/EP/SLP" terminology that was used to refer to the recording quality for VHS recordings.
- Does the 240 in the name mean that it outputs at 240p resolution?
    - The output resolution for the menu and video playback when using it on a CRT is 480i/576i (depending on your config).
- Does 240-MP work over HDMI on a modern television too?
    - Yes! The UI was built to scale on modern televisions over HDMI as well.
    - Please make sure you use the config.txt I provide for HDMI and it will output at the proper resolution for a modern tv.

- Because this is a hobby project (and a fairly niche use case), I am using [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/product/claude-code) to build a large part of the backend C++ code and structure the modules.  If you have concerns with that, I am glad to talk through it.  Also, please feel free to fork this repo, update any aspects and tailor things to your own use case; that's why the source is fully open and available.
